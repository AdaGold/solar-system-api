# Solar System API

Here is a minimal setup for a Flask API.

## Github Setup

1. One person should fork this repo
1. Then, add all group members as _collaborators_ to this forked repo
1. All group members should clone this new, forked, group repo

## Tips

- Don't forget to work in a virtual environment
- Put endpoints in `app/routes.py`
- Add configuration, such as registering blueprints or configuring databases, in `app/__init__.py`
- Commit and push often

## Guidelines for Pair-Programming

- The driver is the person who is at the keyboard and mouse
- The navigator is the person who is thinking out loud, actively collaborating with the driver about the next step, and helping guide the development
- Trade-off driver and navigator roles often
- Take time to make sure you're on the same page
