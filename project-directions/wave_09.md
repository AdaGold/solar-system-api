# Wave 09 - Deployment

Prepare your Solar System API project for deployment. Your Solar System API should:

- Be able to run with `$ flask run` without producing errors
  - To the best of your ability, you should check that no syntax errors, name errors, or other runtime errors occur
- Ensure that the latest version is committed and pushed to GitHub
